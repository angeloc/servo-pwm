LED connected to PWM

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "servo-pwm".

Each servo is represented as a servo-pwm device.

Servo properties:
- pwms : PWM property to point to the PWM device (phandle)/port (id) and to
  specify the period time to be used: <&phandle id period_ns>;
- duty-0 : (optional) [default 500000] duty cycle to set the servo motor at
  0 degrees, useful to compensate for devices drift.
- duty-180 : (optional) [default 2500000] duty cycle to set the servo motor at
  90 degrees, useful to compensate for devices drift.
- angle : (optional) [defaul 0] set the starting angle at driver loading.

Example:

pwm: pwm@0 {
	compatible = "pwm-gpio";
	pwm-gpio = <&pio 6 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
};

servo: servo@0 {
	compatible = "servo-pwm";
	pwms = <&pwm 0 2000000>;
	duty-0 = <60000>;
	duty-180 = <260000>;
	angle = <90>;
};
