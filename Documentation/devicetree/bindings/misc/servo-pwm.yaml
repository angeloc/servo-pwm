title: Servo motor connected to PWM

description:
  Each servo is represented as a servo-pwm device.
  The 20ms period is the accepted standard and so most of the motors
  support it, while the duty cycle to be at min/max positions or how
  many degrees the motor can move varies a lot between manufacturers.
  The most common type of servo (SG90) has 180 degrees and moves
  between 0.5ms and 2.5ms duty cycle.
